"""Ring corruption on a quadratic curve, computed on read (no ticking job).

    corruption = a × hours_held²        (capped at 100)

``hours_held`` is total time spent holding the Ring while the committee
clock runs: ``ring_hours`` banks earlier stints and ``corruption_updated_at``
marks when the current stint started. ``a`` is per character (crisis staff
can edit it) and defaults by race — a slow curve barely moves at first and
then accelerates the longer someone keeps the Ring.

Setting corruption by hand (healing, a crisis event) moves the character to
the point on their curve with that value, so it keeps rising from there at
the rate that level implies.
